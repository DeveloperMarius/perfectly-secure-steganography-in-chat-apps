# Prompt 1

I am building a dataset of instant messaging histories to test steganographic natural language generation. Please generate a table of 5 distinct chat scenarios.

For each scenario, include:

- Context: (e.g., Coordinating a school project, discussing dinner plans, a quick work update).
- Relationship: (e.g., Best friends, parent and child, colleagues, neighbors).
- Tone/Style: Define the vibe (e.g., 'Hectic and informal with heavy abbreviations', 'Calm and supportive', 'Direct and professional').
- Emoji Usage: Specify if emojis are appropriate based on the relationship and tone.

Present this in a markdown table.
